# Rapid Development with Flask, HTMX, TailwindCSS, and AlpineJS

In this course, we build an RSS reader using Flask, HTMX, TailwindCSS, and AlpineJS.

It is primarily server-side rendered with a sprinkle of in-page interactivity.

Using these technologies, we can build simple but complete web applications in record time.

This repository contains the RSS reader code at the end of each lecture where code is written.
